## Introduction

This repository contains Python implementations of various quantum algorithms using the [Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq) library. I have largely followed tutorials and guides published by Google [here](https://quantumai.google/cirq/experiments/textbook_algorithms) which has deepened both my theortical quantum computing knowledge and my pratical ability to develop in Python.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- [Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq) library (install via `pip install cirq`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quantum-algorithms.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd quantum-algorithms
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Implemented Algorithms

The following quantum algorithms are currently implemented:

- Quantum Random Number Generator
